In this project we use the 'AND' dataset which has two forms , one with human-engineered features
and other with images of hand-written text ’and’. We use the human engineered features to build our
two Bayesian Networks where one would represent the two features are from the same writer and the
other would represent they are from diffrent writer. Using this knowledge of probability obtained
from Bayesian Networks we can find out whether the two features belong to handwriting of the same
writer or not.
